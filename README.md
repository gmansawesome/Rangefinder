# Rangefinder

Building a naval rangefinder for Foxhole's warships utilizing computer vision for increased effectiveness.

coordinateCapture - module for capturing and reading binocular coordinates quickly using OCR.


#### Limitations
- OCR will not work if the area behind the coordinates is bright (eg: beaches, some parts of dry concrete, etc). When this occurs a window pop up will appear for assisted manual entry of coordiantes.

- The player compass must be unmodded

- Foxhole (War.exe) must be on your primary monitor (in your computer settings) for OCR to capture your cursor's location properly.
